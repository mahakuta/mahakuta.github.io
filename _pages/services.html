      Our vision is an educational system where skills are equated
    </p>
    <p>
      We intend to work with educational partners on hybrid forms of education
      where theory and practice come together and openness, solidarity and
      accessibility are central.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creative education offers added value because youth learn by doing this,
      develop a critical positive attitude towards technology and can discover,
      test, try and express their creativity.
    </p>
    <p>
      We are in the process of deploying a learning solution for natives in
      Native Languages. Natives can share their knowledge and also earn. We plan
      to create maker spaces for learning, doing and earning.
